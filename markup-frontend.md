## READ THIS FIRST — How Service Markup Works (Plain English)

### What is service markup?

Markup is the **margin** we add on top of provider (e.g. VTpass) prices for data, airtime, cable TV, electricity, and other utility services. It is **not a reward** — it is our **revenue** on each transaction. The user pays (provider price + markup); we keep the markup.

**Example:** VTpass sells a data plan for ₦1,000. If markup for data is set to 7.5%, we show the user ₦1,075 and charge that. We pay VTpass ₦1,000 and keep ₦75. That ₦75 is markup revenue.

- **When markup is ON:** Users see and pay (provider price + markup). We earn the markup amount. Revenue from markup appears in dashboard and transaction reports.
- **When markup is OFF:** Users see and pay the provider price only (no margin). We make no markup on that service.

You can turn markup **on or off globally** and set **per-service** percentages. You can also set a **minimum amount** (e.g. ₦300) below which no markup is applied, so small transactions stay at provider price. Optionally, **“friendly” users** (e.g. partners, test accounts) can have a lower markup % per service.

### The two parts of the system

**Part 1: Global Config** — The master settings for the whole markup program.

| Setting | What it means | Real example |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Markup Active (ON/OFF)** | Master switch. If OFF, no markup is applied on any service — users pay provider price only. | Turn ON when you want to earn margin. Turn OFF to run at cost (e.g. promo or troubleshooting). |
| **Default Markup %** | Fallback percentage when a service has no rule or its rule is inactive. Set to 0 if you only want specific services to have markup. | 7.5% — every service without its own rule (or with rule OFF) uses 7.5%. |
| **Default % (Friendlies)** | Optional lower % for “friendly” users (e.g. partners). Leave empty to use the same as default. | 5% — friendly users get 5% when the service has no rule. |
| **Min Amount to Apply Markup** | Transactions below this amount (NGN) get no markup. Leave 0 or empty for no minimum. | ₦300 — plans below ₦300 show provider price only; ₦300 and above get markup. |

**Part 2: Per-Service Rules** — Different markup percentages (and optional friendly %) per service.

| Service | Display name | Example % | Why different? |
|---------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| `airtime` | Airtime | 5% | High volume; moderate margin |
| `data` | Data | 7.5% | Very common; can support higher margin |
| `cable` | Cable TV | 6% | Recurring subscriptions |
| `electricity` | Electricity | 4% | Large amounts; lower % still good revenue |
| `education` | Education | 0% (OFF) | Not enabled yet |
| `betting` | Betting | 0% (OFF) | Policy or not used |
| `international_airtime` | Intl Airtime | 0% (OFF) | Not enabled yet |

Each rule can override:
- **Percentage** and **Percentage (Friendlies)** — leave friendlies empty to use the same as regular.
- **Min Amount to Apply Markup** — leave empty to use the global config value.

### What are “friendly” users?

Friendly users are accounts (e.g. partners, internal testers) that you want to charge a lower markup. The backend identifies them (e.g. via user flags). When a rule has `percentage_friendlies` set, those users get that lower %; otherwise they get the same % as everyone else.

### What does “Seed All Rules” mean?

When you first open the markup settings page, there may be **no rules** yet — the system doesn’t have a row per service. **“Seed All Rules”** is a one-click button that creates a rule for every service type (airtime, data, cable, electricity, education, betting, international_airtime). All start at **0% and OFF**. After seeding, you set the percentages you want and turn each service ON. You only need to click it once; then you just edit the existing rules.

### Step-by-step: How to set up markup for the first time

1. Open the **Markup** page in admin (under Settings or Pricing).
2. Click **“Seed All Rules”** — this creates a row for every service (all 0%, OFF).
3. Set **Global Config**:
   - Turn markup **ON**.
   - Set default % (e.g. 7.5%) and optional default % for friendlies (e.g. 5%).
   - Set min amount to apply markup (e.g. ₦300), or 0 for no minimum.
   - Save.
4. Go through each service in the table:
   - Data: e.g. 7.5%, friendlies 5%, min amount ₦300, toggle ON.
   - Airtime: e.g. 5%, toggle ON.
   - Cable, electricity: set % and toggle ON as needed.
   - Leave education, betting, international_airtime OFF if you don’t want markup.
   - Save each row (or use bulk save if the UI supports it).
5. Done — data (and any other service you turned on) will use these settings. Revenue from markup appears in your dashboard and transaction reports.

### What happens when a user buys something (the flow)

Example: user buys a data plan. VTpass price = ₦1,000, data rule = 7.5%, min amount = ₦300.

1. System checks: is markup program ON? Yes.
2. System checks: does data have a rule and is it active? Yes, 7.5%.
3. System checks: is ₦1,000 ≥ min amount (₦300)? Yes.
4. Markup = ₦1,000 × 7.5% = ₦75. User is charged ₦1,075. We pay VTpass ₦1,000 and keep ₦75.
5. Transaction is stored with `markup_percent`, `markup_value`; revenue shows in dashboard.

If the same user buys a ₦200 plan (below ₦300), they are charged ₦200 (no markup).

### Backward compatibility (data and .env)

Until you create a **Markup Config** in the database (by saving global config at least once), the **data** service continues to use the old env-based settings: `DATA_MARKUP_ENABLED`, `DATA_MARKUP_PERCENT`, `DATA_MARKUP_PERCENT_FRIENDLIES`. As soon as a row exists in `markup_config`, data (and all services) use the database config only. Other services (airtime, cable, etc.) use the DB config as soon as they call the markup service; if no config exists, they get 0% markup until you configure via this UI.

### What to watch out for / common questions

**Q: If I turn off markup, do existing transactions change?**  
A: No. Turning it off only affects **new** transactions. Past transactions keep their recorded markup.

**Q: If I change the percentage, does it affect past transactions?**  
A: No. Changes apply only to **future** purchases. Existing records are unchanged.

**Q: What if a service rule is OFF but default % is 7.5%?**  
A: That service gets **0%** markup. When a rule exists but is OFF, we respect that — it means you don’t want markup on that service. The default % only applies when there is **no rule** for the service.

**Q: Can I delete a rule?**  
A: Yes. Deleting the rule for a service makes that service use the **global default** % (and global min amount). If you want 0% for a service, it’s better to keep the rule and set 0% or turn it OFF.

**Q: Where do I see revenue from markup?**  
A: In the main admin **Dashboard** (revenue breakdown) and in **Transactions** (per-transaction `markup_value` and revenue totals). Markup is not a separate “markup history” — it’s part of normal transaction and revenue reporting.

## What Admin Can Do (Quick List)

1. **Toggle markup ON / OFF** — master switch for all services.
2. **Set global defaults** — default %, default % for friendlies, min amount to apply markup.
3. **Manage per-service rules** — set markup % (and optional friendlies %, min amount) for airtime, data, cable, electricity, education, betting, international_airtime.
4. **Seed all rules at once** — one-click first-time setup so every service has a row to edit.
5. **Turn individual services on/off** — use the Active toggle per service without changing others.

      },
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "service_type": "airtime",
        "is_active": true,
        "percentage": 5,

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Config fields:**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|
| `is_active` | boolean | Master switch. OFF = no markup on any service. |
| `default_percentage` | number | Fallback % when a service has no rule or rule is inactive. |
| `default_percentage_friendlies` | number \| null | Fallback % for friendly users. null = use `default_percentage`. |
| `min_amount_to_apply_markup` | number \| null | Minimum transaction amount (NGN) to apply markup. Below this, no markup. null/0 = no minimum. |

**Rule fields:**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|
| `service_type` | string | One of: `airtime`, `data`, `cable`, `electricity`, `education`, `betting`, `international_airtime` |
| `is_active` | boolean | When false, this service uses global default (or no markup if global off). |
| `percentage` | number | Markup % for regular users. |
| `percentage_friendlies` | number \| null | Markup % for friendly users. null = use `percentage`. |
| `min_amount_to_apply_markup` | number \| null | Override global minimum for this service. null = use config value. |

**Note:** `percentage_friendlies: null` and `min_amount_to_apply_markup: null` on a rule mean “use the global config value”. In the UI, show these as empty/placeholder and display the global value as hint.

---

### 2. Update Global Config

**PUT** `/api/v1/unified-admin/markup/config`

All fields optional — send only what you want to change.

#### Full payload reference

| Field | Type | Default | What it controls |
|-------|------|--------|------------------|
| `is_active` | boolean | `false` | **Master switch** — ON = markup applied per rules; OFF = no markup on any service. |
| `default_percentage` | number | `0` | Fallback % when a service has no rule or rule is inactive. |
| `default_percentage_friendlies` | number | — | Fallback % for friendly users. Omit or null = use `default_percentage`. |
| `min_amount_to_apply_markup` | number | `0` | Min transaction amount (NGN) to apply markup. 0 = no minimum. |

#### Example: Turn on markup with 7.5% default

```json
{
  "is_active": true,
  "default_percentage": 7.5,
  "default_percentage_friendlies": 5,
  "min_amount_to_apply_markup": 300
}
```

#### Example: Turn off markup

```json
{
  "is_active": false
}
```

#### Response

Returns the same shape as GET config (updated `config` + full `rules`).

---

### 3. List Rules

**GET** `/api/v1/unified-admin/markup/rules`

Returns all markup rules (one per service that has a rule).

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Markup rules fetched",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "service_type": "airtime",
      "is_active": true,
      "percentage": 5,
      "percentage_friendlies": null,
      "min_amount_to_apply_markup": null,
      "updated_by": "admin-uuid",
      "createdAt": "2026-03-13T00:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-03-13T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 4. Create Rule

**POST** `/api/v1/unified-admin/markup/rules`

One rule per `service_type`. If a rule for that service already exists, the API returns 400 — use update instead.

#### Request body

```json
{
  "service_type": "data",
  "percentage": 7.5,
  "is_active": true,
  "percentage_friendlies": 5,
  "min_amount_to_apply_markup": 300
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| `service_type` | string | **Yes** | One of: `airtime`, `data`, `cable`, `electricity`, `education`, `betting`, `international_airtime` |
| `percentage` | number | **Yes** | Markup % for regular users. |
| `is_active` | boolean | No | Default: `true`. |
| `percentage_friendlies` | number | No | Markup % for friendly users. Omit or null = use `percentage`. |
| `min_amount_to_apply_markup` | number | No | Min amount (NGN) for this service. Omit or null = use global config. |

---

### 5. Seed All Rules (first-time setup)

**POST** `/api/v1/unified-admin/markup/rules/seed`

No request body. Creates a rule for every service type that doesn’t already have one. All new rules start at **0% and OFF**.

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Created 7 markup rules",
  "data": [
    { "id": "uuid", "service_type": "airtime", "percentage": 0, "is_active": false, "percentage_friendlies": null, "min_amount_to_apply_markup": null },
    { "id": "uuid", "service_type": "data", "percentage": 0, "is_active": false, "percentage_friendlies": null, "min_amount_to_apply_markup": null },
    { "id": "uuid", "service_type": "cable", "percentage": 0, "is_active": false, "percentage_friendlies": null, "min_amount_to_apply_markup": null },
    { "id": "uuid", "service_type": "electricity", "percentage": 0, "is_active": false, "percentage_friendlies": null, "min_amount_to_apply_markup": null },
    { "id": "uuid", "service_type": "education", "percentage": 0, "is_active": false, "percentage_friendlies": null, "min_amount_to_apply_markup": null },
    { "id": "uuid", "service_type": "betting", "percentage": 0, "is_active": false, "percentage_friendlies": null, "min_amount_to_apply_markup": null },
    { "id": "uuid", "service_type": "international_airtime", "percentage": 0, "is_active": false, "percentage_friendlies": null, "min_amount_to_apply_markup": null }
  ]
}
```

**When to show the Seed button:** Only when the `rules` array from `GET /config` is empty (or has fewer than 7 items and you want to fill gaps). Once all services have rules, hide or disable the button. Calling seed again is safe — it only creates missing rules.

---

### 6. Update Rule

**PUT** `/api/v1/unified-admin/markup/rules/:id`

Send only the fields you want to change.

#### Example

```json
{
  "percentage": 8,
  "percentage_friendlies": 5,
  "is_active": true,
  "min_amount_to_apply_markup": 250
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|
| `percentage` | number | Markup % for regular users. |
| `percentage_friendlies` | number | Markup % for friendly users. Omit or null = use `percentage`. |
| `is_active` | boolean | Turn this service’s markup on or off. |
| `min_amount_to_apply_markup` | number | Override min amount for this service. Omit or null = use global. |

---

### 7. Delete Rule

**DELETE** `/api/v1/unified-admin/markup/rules/:id`

Removes the rule. That service then uses the **global default** % and global min amount.

**Recommendation:** Prefer setting the rule to 0% or turning it OFF instead of deleting, so the service doesn’t unexpectedly use the global default.

---

## Settings Page UI Suggestion

Build a **dedicated Markup** page (e.g. under Settings or Pricing) with one main view: **Settings**.

```

**On page load:**

1. Call `GET /unified-admin/markup/config` — fill global section and rules table.
2. If `rules` is empty (or you want to ensure all 7 services), show **“Seed All Rules”**. After seeding, the table shows all 7 services at 0% / OFF.

**On save global config:** Call `PUT /unified-admin/markup/config` with only the fields that changed.

**On save rules:** For each changed row, call `PUT /unified-admin/markup/rules/:id` with the new values.

**Show confirmation dialogs before:**

- Toggling markup ON/OFF (affects all users immediately).
- Changing percentages (affects all future purchases for that service).

**Short note on page:** “Markup is our revenue margin on provider prices, not a user reward. Revenue appears in Dashboard and Transactions.”
